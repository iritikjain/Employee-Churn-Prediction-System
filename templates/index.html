            Employee Churn is defined as the percentage of employees leaving an
            organization over a specific period of time.

          <p class="lead my-3">
            The churn rate is frequently referred to as employee attrition rate
            or employee turnover rate. Employee churn rate indicates how
            frequently the companyâ€™s employees quit their jobs within a given
            period. Note that employee churn rates can significantly vary among
            companies and industries.

                According to the Society of Human Resources Management's (SHRM) 2018 Employee Recognition Report, employee churn is the number one challenge for most organizations globally. A staggering 29% of these organizations admitted to being stressed about finding replacements. Although a certain level of employee turnover is normal in any organization, however, high rates of employee churn can be a costly affair.

                In today's world, many organizations focus on maintaining their
                reputation, business standards and performance. So to achieve
                this, they first train their newly joined employees and spend
                huge amount on these trainings. But usually most of these
                employees switch their jobs within a short span of joining. In
                most cases employees with niche skills are harder to replace.
                This affects the ongoing work and productivity of existing
                employees. Again acquiring new employees as a replacement has
                its huge costs such as hiring costs and training costs. Also,
                the new employee will take time to learn skills to be at par of
                technical or business expertise knowledge of the older employee.
                Organizations can simply tackle this problem by applying Machine
                Learning techniques to predict employee churn, which helps them
                in taking necessary actions such as negotiating with the
                employees, mentoring and guiding to retain them.

                This project aims to solve the above mentioned problem by using
                Azure Machine Learning Service. It uses Two-Class Decision
                Forest module to create a machine learning model based on the
                random decision forests algorithm. The accuracy of this ML model
                is 98.70%. The input data is passed to the ML Model Web Service and
                the model evaluates the data and sends back the prediction of
                whether the employee will leave the company or not. In this
                way, the organizations can take necessary actions for the
                employees who are on the verge of leaving the company.
